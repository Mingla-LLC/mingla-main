## ORCH-0672 invariant (2026-04-25) — Coupled-diff partial commit prevention

### I-COUPLED-DIFF-NEVER-PARTIAL-COMMIT

**Rule:** Any working-tree diff that touches ≥2 files where one file *defines* a
symbol and another file *consumes* that symbol (token, type, function, prop, RPC,
RLS policy, migration, edge fn handler, etc.) is **COUPLED**. A coupled diff MUST
be committed atomically — either all halves in one commit, or none at all. Partial
commits of coupled diffs are forbidden.

**Concrete examples of coupling:**
- `designSystem.ts` token block + `Component.tsx` consumer reads (this incident)
- `migration.sql` schema add + `service.ts` query against new column
- `edge-fn/index.ts` handler + mobile service call against new payload shape
- `types.ts` interface change + every component that reads/writes the type
- New RPC + caller that invokes it
- New CHECK constraint + service that produces values matching the constraint

**Enforcement:**

1. **Forensics + orchestrator capture step (process):** when an in-flight diff is
   captured (e.g., during investigation of a different issue), each file in the
   diff MUST be classified as either `single-half` (safe to commit alone or revert
   alone) or `coupled-with: <other-file-list>` (must move together). Capture
   without classification is incomplete.
2. **Commit-time guard (process):** before any partial-stage commit (e.g.,
   `git commit -- <pathspec>` or `git add -p` followed by commit), the developer
   MUST grep for outbound symbol references from the staged half to confirm the
   consumer half is either also staged in the same commit OR already on HEAD.
3. **CI-time guard (deferred — separate work):** future CI gate could grep for
   newly-introduced token reads in committed files where the token is undefined
   in the same commit's tree state. Tracked as a future improvement; manual
   discipline holds until then.

**Test that catches a regression:**

```bash
# Negative control: simulate the ORCH-0672 regression by removing the pending
# block from designSystem.ts while leaving the consumer reads in
# GlassSessionSwitcher.tsx — Metro bundle must fail with module-load TypeError.
# Positive control: with both halves present, Metro bundle succeeds.
cd app-mobile && npx expo export --platform ios 2>&1 | grep -E "(TypeError|Cannot read property)"
# Expected: empty (positive) or specific error pointing at the missing definition (negative).
```

**Origin:** Registered 2026-04-25 after ORCH-0672 S0 emergency — commit
`3911b696 fix(home): pin Solo + create pills` shipped only the consumer half
(`GlassSessionSwitcher.tsx +226/-66` reading `glass.chrome.pending.*` tokens at
17 sites) without the matching token-definition half (`designSystem.ts` +39-line
`pending` sub-namespace). Module-load crash bricked dev build for ~hours until
ORCH-0672 hotfix landed at commit `d566dab7`. ORCH-0669 forensics had captured
the in-flight diff but did not classify it as coupled — orchestrator + forensics
both missed the partial-commit risk. This invariant closes the regression class.

**Severity if violated:** S0 (module-load build brick), S1 (runtime call into
undefined function), or data-integrity (missing migration before service that
queries new column) depending on which symbol class is incomplete.

## ORCH-0669 invariant (2026-04-25) — Home + chat chrome hairline sub-perceptible

### I-CHROME-HAIRLINE-SUB-PERCEPTIBLE

**Rule:** The shared `glass.chrome.border.hairline` token defines the perimeter
edge of every Home + bottom-nav chrome surface AND the chat input capsule
(which by original-author intent shares the home-chrome design language per the
inline comment at `MessageInterface.tsx` capsule styles, "matching the
home-chrome capsule language"). Its white alpha MUST be `≤ 0.08`. Any consumer
of chrome edge styling — chrome surface (`Glass*.tsx`, `ui/Glass*.tsx`) OR
chat input chrome (`MessageInterface.tsx` capsule + reply preview + separator)
— MUST consume this token by reference; inline `rgba(255, 255, 255, X)`
literals with white alpha ≥ 0.09 on these files are forbidden.

**Cross-property note:** The token is consumed by both `borderColor` (perimeter
strokes — surfaces 1-7) and `backgroundColor` (1px-wide chat input separator —
surface 8). The invariant binds the token VALUE; the property choice is at the
consumer's discretion. Future consumers using this token as a `backgroundColor`
for a thin filled element should expect that element to be sub-perceptible at
the locked alpha — by design (Option A locked by founder 2026-04-25).

**Excluded scope (DOES NOT apply to):**
- `glass.chrome.pending.borderColor` — ORCH-0661 dashed pending-pill state,
  intentionally higher visibility (28%).
- `glass.chrome.active.border` — orange active-state border, separate token
  (`'rgba(235, 120, 37, 0.55)'`, no white-alpha concern).
- Non-chrome surfaces (`Card*.tsx`, `Badge*.tsx`, modals, sheets, profile,
  discover) — different design languages, separate token systems.
- Sibling `topHighlight` tokens in `glass.badge.border.*`, `glass.profile.card.*`,
  `glass.profile.cardElevated.*` namespaces — governed by their own design specs.

**Why it exists:** Two prior incidents created visible white-line artifacts on
Home chrome:
1. ORCH-0589 V5 deleted the L3 top-highlight overlay because it produced a
   visible white line at chrome scale.
2. ORCH-0669 (this work) lowered the L4 hairline alpha from 0.12 to 0.06
   because at 0.12 it produced a visible white seam.

The pattern: edge-definition layers on Home chrome must remain *sub-perceptible*
— the chrome should feel "edge-defined" without anyone consciously seeing an
edge. This invariant locks that bar going forward. Any new chrome element added
later (e.g., `GlassFloatingActionButton`) must consume
`glass.chrome.border.hairline` and not exceed the alpha cap.

**Enforcement:**
1. **Token value cap (in code):** the token at `app-mobile/src/constants/designSystem.ts`
   `glass.chrome.border.hairline` is locked at `'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)'`
   with a justification comment block warning future readers.
2. **CI grep gate** in `scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh` block
   `I-CHROME-HAIRLINE-SUB-PERCEPTIBLE` — fails if any chrome consumer file
   (`Glass*.tsx` in `components/`, `Glass*.tsx` in `components/ui/`, or
   `MessageInterface.tsx`) inlines a `borderColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.X)'`
   literal with white alpha ≥ 0.09.

**Test that catches a regression:**

```bash
# Negative control: simulate the regression by adding an inline borderColor
# at 0.10 alpha to a chrome consumer — gate exits 1.
sed -i 's|borderColor: glass.chrome.border.hairline,|borderColor: '\''rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10)'\'',|' app-mobile/src/components/ui/GlassIconButton.tsx
bash scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh   # expect exit 1 with descriptive error
git checkout -- app-mobile/src/components/ui/GlassIconButton.tsx
bash scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh   # expect exit 0
```

**Severity if violated:** S2 (cosmetic; first-impression damage on every Home
render — chrome reads as a hard white seam against dark blur backdrop, breaks
the "premium glass" intent of SPEC_ORCH-0589 V5).

**Origin:** Registered 2026-04-25 after ORCH-0669 cycle 2 implementation.
Investigation: `reports/INVESTIGATION_ORCH-0669_HOME_HEADER_GLASS_EDGES.md`.
Spec: `specs/SPEC_ORCH-0669_HOME_CHROME_HAIRLINE.md` (v2 — Option A locked
2026-04-25 to share lower alpha across all 7 consumers, accept chat-separator
near-invisibility).

## ORCH-0664 invariant (2026-04-25) — DM realtime dedup ordering

### I-DEDUP-AFTER-DELIVERY

**Rule:** Dedup tracking sets (e.g., `broadcastSeenIds`, idempotency keys,
request-id sets, "already-processed" caches) MUST be populated INSIDE the
success path of the delivery they are deduping, AFTER the user-visible state
has been mutated. Pre-emptive population (before delegation) creates a class
of bug where the secondary delivery path silently skips because the dedup set
falsely reports "already delivered" when the primary path was a no-op.

**Why:** Pre-fix root cause RC-0664 — `useBroadcastReceiver.ts:51` marked
`broadcastSeenIds.add(msg.id)` BEFORE the delegate ran, the delegate was a
no-op, then `subscribeToConversation`'s postgres_changes backup saw the
seen flag and silently skipped its `setMessages` add. Result: every DM
receiver dropped every incoming message until close+reopen reload.

**Enforcement:**
1. **Code review checklist:** any `*.add(id)` adjacent to a delegate call
   must come AFTER the delegate, not before.
2. **CI grep gate** in `scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh` —
   `useBroadcastReceiver.ts` MUST NOT contain `broadcastSeenIds.current.add(`
   inside the broadcast event handler. Population is the
   `ConnectionsPage.addIncomingMessageToUI` handler's responsibility.
3. **Required-prop contract** — `MessageInterface.tsx`'s
   `onBroadcastReceive` is REQUIRED (non-optional) so TypeScript catches
   any caller that forgets to wire the callback. "No-op fallback" was the
   exact pre-fix shape that caused the bug.
4. **Protective comment blocks** at three sites (useBroadcastReceiver.ts
   handler body, ConnectionsPage.tsx `addIncomingMessageToUI` JSDoc,
   MessageInterface.tsx header comment above `useBroadcastReceiver` call).

**Test that catches a regression:**

```bash
# Negative control: re-introduce the pre-emptive add — gate exits 1.
sed -i 's|// Deliver — delegate is responsible|broadcastSeenIds.current.add(msg.id);\n        // Deliver — delegate is responsible|' app-mobile/src/hooks/useBroadcastReceiver.ts
bash scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh   # expect exit 1 with descriptive error
git checkout -- app-mobile/src/hooks/useBroadcastReceiver.ts
bash scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh   # expect exit 0
```

**Exception (legitimate pre-emptive add permitted):** when the caller has
ALREADY mutated state in another way and is ITSELF the producer of the work
the dedup set protects against. The canonical example is the SENDER's own
add at `ConnectionsPage.tsx` L1936-area (was L1907 pre-helper-insertion):
sender has already shown the message via optimistic-replace; the seen-set
add is correct because the UI mutation is local-side, not delegate-side.
The CDC echo of the sender's own write must not re-add the message.

**Severity if violated:** S1 (every receiver of every message silently
drops from UI; user sees empty chat until close+reopen reload).

**Origin:** Registered 2026-04-25 after ORCH-0664 root cause proof.
Spec: `specs/SPEC_ORCH-0664_DM_REALTIME_DEDUP.md`. Investigation:
`reports/INVESTIGATION_ORCH-0663_0664_0665_CHAT_TRIPLE.md`.

## ORCH-0558 invariants (2026-04-21) — Collab match promotion

### I-MATCH-PROMOTION-DETERMINISTIC

**Rule:** Meeting the collab quorum threshold (≥2 right-swipes on the same
experience in the same session) MUST produce exactly one
`board_saved_cards` row, regardless of concurrency or timing.

**Enforcement:**
- Advisory lock on `(session_id, experience_id)` at check_mutual_like
  trigger entry (migration `20260421000003_orch_0558_trigger_v3.sql`)
- Unique index `board_saved_cards_session_experience_unique` on
  `(session_id, experience_id)` (migration `20260421000002`)
- `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (session_id, experience_id) DO NOTHING` in the
  promotion path — losers fall into attach-vote branch

**Test:** `supabase/tests/concurrency/collab_match_race.sql` — 100-run
harness with dblink-spawned concurrent transactions; exactly 1 saved_card
and exactly N votes per run. Orchestrator Close gate.

### I-BOARD-SAVED-CARDS-EXPERIENCE-ID-NOT-NULL

**Rule:** No row in `board_saved_cards` may have `experience_id = NULL`.
Historical ghosts were cleaned up in migration `20260421000001`.

**Enforcement:** `ALTER TABLE board_saved_cards ALTER COLUMN experience_id
SET NOT NULL` (migration `20260421000002`).

**Test:** `SELECT count(*) FROM board_saved_cards WHERE experience_id IS
NULL` must always return 0. Any INSERT with NULL fails with `23502`.

### I-CHECK-FOR-MATCH-COLUMN-ALIGNED

**Rule:** Any code that determines "was this card promoted in this
session?" must use the same semantics as the trigger's existence check.
Post-ORCH-0558 the single server authority is
`rpc_record_swipe_and_check_match`; no client-side `board_saved_cards`
query determines match state.

**Enforcement:**
- `BoardCardService.checkForMatch` removed
- Client-side match detection goes through the RPC only

**Test:** `git grep -n "'experience_id'" app-mobile/src/services/boardCardService.ts`
must return zero lines within 20 lines of a `.from('board_saved_cards')`
match-intent read. Enforced during code review.

### I-MATCH-NOTIFICATION-FAILS-OPEN

**Rule:** If push delivery fails or is disabled, in-app notification
still fires. If in-app fails, the match toast still fires (client-local,
no external dependency).

**Enforcement:**
- `notify-dispatch` INSERTs the `notifications` row BEFORE attempting
  push (existing behavior verified 2026-04-21). The
  `useNotifications` hook subscribes via Supabase Realtime and surfaces
  new matches in-app instantly.
- `notify-session-match` emits `collab_match_notification_delivered`
  per successful in-app insert and `collab_match_notification_failed`
  per dispatch error.
- `collabSaveCard` match toast is client-local — fires from local RPC
  response, independent of push/edge-fn availability.

**Test:** Device test with airplane mode toggled after the RPC returns
matched=true — match toast still fires on the matcher's device. Non-matcher
participants see the `notifications` row via Realtime INSERT as soon as
network returns.

### I-REALTIME-COLD-FETCH-PARITY

**Rule:** Session Cards tab shows the same set of saved cards whether
reached via realtime INSERT event or via cold-open fetch.

**Enforcement:**
- `SessionViewModal.loadSavedCards` runs on modal open (cold fetch)
- `onCardSaved` realtime subscription updates on board_saved_cards INSERT
- `onMatchPromoted` (board_votes INSERT) belt catches missed INSERT
  events with a 1s debounced refetch
- Ghost rows eliminated by migration 000001, so saved_at DESC ordering
  stops hiding fresh matches behind stale entries

**Test:** Device test — match occurs while user is on Home tab, then
opens Cards tab cold — card must be present.

### I-COLLAB-MATCH-OBSERVABLE

**Rule:** Every attempted match promotion emits a telemetry event with a
machine-readable reason — engineering sees failures in production without
waiting for user reports.

**Enforcement:**
- `match_telemetry_events` table (migration 000004) receives events from:
  - `check_mutual_like` trigger (every decision path)
  - `rpc_record_swipe_and_check_match` RPC (attempt events)
  - `notify-session-match` edge fn (delivered / failed)
- Mobile `collabSaveCard` mirrors outcomes to Mixpanel
  (`Collab Match Attempt`, `Collab Match Promotion Success`,
  `Collab Match Promotion Skipped`, `Collab Match RPC Error`)

**Test:** After a successful match,
`SELECT count(*) FROM match_telemetry_events WHERE session_id = X AND
event_type = 'collab_match_promotion_success'` returns exactly 1.
Mixpanel shows the mirror events in the product funnel.

---

## Carried invariants (preserved from prior ORCH work)

- **I-02 One owner per truth** — no two systems authoritatively describe
  the same state. ORCH-0558: RPC is the single server authority for
  match state; client has no independent match-detection query path.
- **I-03 No silent failures** — every catch block surfaces the error via
  toast, telemetry, or console.warn. ORCH-0558 preserves this across the
  new RPC call, the rewired `collabSaveCard`, and the edge fn telemetry.
- **I-08 Subtract before adding** — `saveCardToBoard` and `checkForMatch`
  were removed entirely, not deprecated and left in place. No dead code
  paths left behind.
- **I-11 One auth instance** — RPC uses `auth.uid()` and validates
  against `session_participants.has_accepted`. No separate auth layer.
- **I-TRIGGER-READS-CURRENT-SCHEMA** — `check_mutual_like` must never
  reference a dropped table (ORCH-0556 origin). Enforced by the periodic
  `supabase/tests/concurrency/collab_match_race.sql` run, which would
  fail on 42P01.

---

## ORCH-0646 invariants (2026-04-23) — Column-drop cleanup discipline

### I-COLUMN-DROP-CLEANUP-EXHAUSTIVE

**Rule:** Any migration that drops a column (or renames a materialized-view
projection) MUST be paired with grep gates before its cutover migration is
considered ready:

1. Grep `mingla-admin/src/` for the dropped column name — ZERO matches.
2. Grep `app-mobile/src/` for the dropped column name — ZERO matches.
3. Grep `supabase/functions/` for the dropped column name — ZERO matches
   (allowing deletion-proving comments like `// ORCH-XXXX ch13: COLUMN dropped`).
4. Inspect every function body in `public` schema via
   `SELECT pg_get_functiondef(oid) FROM pg_proc` grep for the column name —
   ZERO matches (or only in functions scheduled for drop in the same cutover).

**Enforcement:** CI script `scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh` covers gates
(1)-(3) at the source-tree level. Gate (4) is a manual pre-cutover check
until there's automation against live DB.

**Origin:** ORCH-0640 dropped `place_pool.ai_approved` on 2026-04-23 with
mobile cleanup verified and 14 admin RPCs rewritten, but six other RPCs and
23 admin JSX sites were missed. Admin Place Pool + Signal Library broke in
prod for hours until the user surfaced it. CLOSE Grade A was awarded without
admin smoke because the tester matrix was mobile-only. ORCH-0646 completed
the cleanup and registered this invariant so column drops never again ship
with missing surface coverage.

**Regression test:** The CI script runs on every push. Any new
`ai_approved` / `ai_override` / `ai_validated` reference introduced in
`mingla-admin/src/`, `app-mobile/src/`, or the four serving edge functions
fails the gate (exit 1).

**Manual pre-cutover check (example template):**
```bash
COLUMN="ai_approved"
for DIR in mingla-admin/src/ app-mobile/src/ supabase/functions/; do
  MATCHES=$(grep -rn "$COLUMN" "$DIR" | grep -vE '\.md$' || true)
  if [ -n "$MATCHES" ]; then
    echo "FAIL: $COLUMN still referenced in $DIR:"
    echo "$MATCHES"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

## ORCH-0668 invariants (2026-04-25) — RPC language discipline for hot paths

### I-RPC-LANGUAGE-SQL-FOR-HOT-PATH

**Definition:** Any PostgreSQL RPC called from a Supabase Edge Function on a
user-facing hot path with array (`text[]`, `uuid[]`) or composite parameters
MUST be `LANGUAGE sql STABLE`, OR `LANGUAGE plpgsql` with both:
  (a) `SET plan_cache_mode = force_custom_plan` in `proconfig`, AND
  (b) a `[CRITICAL — I-RPC-LANGUAGE-SQL-FOR-HOT-PATH]` justification block
      in the migration body explaining why plpgsql is required.

**Rationale:** Plpgsql functions cache query plans per session. After ≥5
invocations, plpgsql switches from custom (per-call optimized) plans to a
generic (parameter-blind) plan. For RPCs with variable-cardinality array
parameters and cost-sensitive joins (cardinality of `text[]` × table scan),
the generic plan is catastrophic — observed 100× slowdown vs equivalent
inline SQL. Combined with the 8 s `authenticator.statement_timeout` ceiling,
this turns a soft perf regression into universal hard failure (ORCH-0668).

**Hot-path RPCs subject to this invariant** (allowlist — additions require review):
- `public.query_person_hero_places_by_signal`
- `public.query_servable_places_by_signal`
- `public.fetch_local_signal_ranked`

**Exempt RPCs** (admin / cron / batch — not user-facing hot paths):
- `public.cron_refresh_admin_place_pool_mv` (has 15 min `statement_timeout`
  override; plpgsql for control flow)

**Why we re-introduce risk:** Re-introducing `LANGUAGE plpgsql` for any of
the listed hot-path RPCs without `plan_cache_mode = force_custom_plan` AND
the justification comment will:
1. Pass headless tests (raw-SQL probes don't exercise plpgsql plan caching).
2. Pass for the first 5 invocations after every connection re-use.
3. Then silently start hitting the 8 s `authenticator.statement_timeout` for
   any caller passing ≥6 array elements, returning HTTP 500 to mobile,
   surfacing as universal "Couldn't load recommendations" with no diagnostic.

**Owner:** Backend RPC layer.
**Gate:** `scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh` block I-RPC-LANGUAGE-SQL-FOR-HOT-PATH.
**Established:** ORCH-0668 (2026-04-25). Investigation:
`reports/INVESTIGATION_ORCH-0668_PAIRED_PROFILE_RECOMMENDATIONS_FAIL.md`.
Spec: `specs/SPEC_ORCH-0668_PAIRED_PROFILE_RPC_FIX.md`.
**Related:** I-THREE-GATE-SERVING (DEC-053), ORCH-0540 plpgsql wrapper precedent,
`feedback_headless_qa_rpc_gap.md` (mandatory live-fire for SQL RPCs before CLOSE).

---

### I-DECK-CARD-CONTRACT-DISTANCE-AND-TIME

**Rule:** Every card emitted by any deck-serving edge function MUST carry
haversine-computed `distanceKm` (km) AND per-mode `travelTimeMin` (min). If
user location OR place lat/lng is missing, BOTH fields drop to `null` together.
Mobile UI branches on `null` to hide the badge. Never `0` sentinel; never
`|| t(...nearby)` fallback; never return literal `'Nearby'` from
`parseAndFormatDistance` on missing input (lines 223/230/238 for
genuinely-tiny distances deferred to ORCH-0673 i18n).

**Enforcement:** Single owner `_shared/distanceMath.ts` exports
`haversineKm`/`estimateTravelMinutes`/`TravelMode`; `_shared/stopAlternatives.ts`
re-exports. CI gate `scripts/ci-check-invariants.sh` blocks 4 patterns:
edge-fn zero literals, mobile `|| t(...nearby)`, formatters
`if (!distanceString...return 'Nearby'`, `timeAway` field assignments. Type:
`Recommendation.distance/travelTime` and `CardInfoSectionProps.distance/travelTime`
are `string | null`; `ExpandedCardData` widened + new `travelMode?: string`.

**Test:** Live `discover-cards` × 4 travel modes returns non-zero distanceKm +
travelTimeMin. Negative controls NC-1..NC-4 fire `exit 1` on regression
injection and recover `exit 0` on revert.

**Established:** ORCH-0659 + ORCH-0660 (2026-04-25, rework v2 bundles tester
F-1 fix). Artifacts:
`reports/INVESTIGATION_ORCH-0659_0660_DECK_DISTANCE_TRAVELTIME.md`,
