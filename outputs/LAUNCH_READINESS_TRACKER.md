## Curated Card Integrity (Previously Hardened)

| Item | Grade | Last Verified | Evidence | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|-------|
| CRIT-001: Pool reference validity | C | 2026-03-19 | Migration deployed | Needs full pipeline verification |
| CRIT-002: Cascade deactivation | C | 2026-03-19 | Migration deployed | Needs full pipeline verification |
| CRIT-003: No orphaned curated cards | C | 2026-03-19 | Migration deployed | Needs full pipeline verification |

## How to Use This Tracker

1. **Before starting work:** Read the relevant section to understand current state.
2. **After completing a pipeline:** Update the grade with evidence.
3. **When discovering a new issue:** Add it immediately at grade F.
4. **Grade promotion requires proof.** Test results, not claims.
5. **Never downgrade without explanation.** If something regressed, document why.

**The tracker reflects reality. If you're unsure, the grade is F.**
